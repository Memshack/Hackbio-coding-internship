The first stage invloved us writing a code to process the personal information of all our group members (Name, Slack Username, Email, Country, Hobby, Discipline and Preffered programming language). 
Coding in R, i used the "list()" function as the overall dataset to contain all our information

I also used The paste() function in R is used to combine multiple strings together into a single string to help organize my information
Finall display of information was then dont by the print() function.
