# Hackbio-coding-internship
The first stage invloved us writing a code to process the personal information of all our group members (Name, Slack Username, Email, Country, Hobby, Discipline and Preffered programming language). 
Coding in R, i used the "list()" function as the overall dataset to contain all our information
Then i used simple vectors "c()" to organize the various sub-groups such as "Name" in the list
I also used The paste() function in R is used to combine multiple strings together into a single string to help organize my information
Final display of information was then dont by the print() function.
The Second Stage invloved Writing a function for translating DNA to protein, one that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve.
one that generates a dataframe with 100 different growth curves and another determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
Finally, we were asked to write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you don’t have one). Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.
